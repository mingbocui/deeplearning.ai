# deeplearning.ai

### Course Introduction
This repository includes all the coding projects of deeplearning.ai specialization courses on Coursera. It is composed of five courses, but only four of them are assigned with projects. The projects contains many detailed aspect of AI, such as **Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization**, and more.

### How to start?
Since I have included all the files you need, including **datasets, images and model files**, you just need to clone this repository to your local computer and then you could run them on the jupyter notebook successfully.

**Enjoy your journey through the AI world**
