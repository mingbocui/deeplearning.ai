# deeplearning.ai

### Course Introduction
This repository includes all the coding projects of deeplearning.ai specialization courses on Coursera. It is composed of five courses, but only four of them are assigned with projects. The projects contains many detailed aspect of AI, such as **Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization**, and more.
